# WASM Smart Contract Workshop

## Introduction

This is a simple WASM PSP22 asset manager dApp for the Amsterdam workshop.

In this workshop, we will create a PSP22 (ERC20) smart contract using Solidity and Ink on our Shibuya WASM smart contract VM and read from both contracts as if they were written in the same language.

## Installation

1. Run `yarn` to install all the dependencies of this dApp.
2. Install the cargo-contract using [this guide](https://github.com/paritytech/cargo-contract#installation).
3. Install solang from [this repo](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/solang).
